|    | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid| Median|
|:---|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|------:|
|mah |        3|              3539|       1179.67|   1311|

The dataset covers 4 hybrid open access articles. Total expenditure amounts to  10123 €. Average  fee is 2530.8 € and the median 2631 €.

The following institutions have contributed its expenditures for hybrid open access.
