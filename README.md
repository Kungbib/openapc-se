# About Open APC Sweden

Open APC Sweden is a pilot project initiated by the National Library of Sweden together with Swedish higher education institutions (HEIs) in order to investigate the possibilities of establishing an open open access publication cost system. 

In order to establish Open APC Sweden there is a great need for a concerted effort by stakeholders. The current project aims to keep the Swedish HEI sector informed about ways in which to monitor the total cost of publication, which includes the collection of APCs. 

### Initial workshop in May 2016

A first [report](http://www.kb.se/dokument/open%20access/Open_APC_Sweden_English_LAST.pdf) from the pilot with the results from an initial workshop held in 2016 is now published at [OpenAccess.se](http://www.kb.se/openaccess/Open-APC-Sweden/). The report concludes that Sweden has currently no common funding system in place in order to finance and handle invoices for Article Processing Charges (APCs) paid in order to publish open access articles, fulfilling the demands of research funders. A Swedish open APC database, like the Open APC Initiative in Germany, would therefore be difficult to implement in Sweden at present. 

The result from the first workshop proposes two options which could dramatically facilitate the collection and monitoring of Swedish APC data. Firstly, Swedish HEIs need to establish a common invoice code for APCs in their respective accounts and invoice processing systems. Secondly, institutional repositories need to enable the registration of metadata about “corresponding author”, who receives and pays for incurred APC costs via an invoice directly addressed to the author in question. The survey data in this pilot project includes only journal articles. 

#### Open APC Sweden Symposium 2016
On the 25th of November 2016 the National Library of Sweden invited all stakeholders to attend a national symposium on APCs and Open APC Sweden. 

Prof. Stephen Pinfield at the University of Sheffield delivered the keynote speech regarding the total cost of publication in a hybrid open access environment, followed by representatives from Swedish HEIs and funding agencies presenting their experiences of monitoring APCs in Sweden.  

The presentations from the symposium are published at: [Open APC Sweden](http://www.kb.se/openaccess/Open-APC-Sweden/).

## Aim

**The aim of this Open APC Sweden repository is to:**  

* Release datasets on fees paid for open access journal articles by the Swedish HEI sector

* Demonstrate how reporting on fee-based open access publishing can be made more transparent and reproducible across institutions. This is an important aspect in the preparation for a transition from a subscription-based market to an open access publishing infrastructure 

* Establish a valid empirical foundation which can only be realised by standardised reporting on APC costs
