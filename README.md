# About Openapc-se

This is a pilot project. This survey includes only journal articles.   

A first [report](http://www.kb.se/dokument/open%20access/APC_2016_161003_2.pdf) from the pilot with the results from the initial workshop is now published at [OpenAccess.se](http://www.kb.se/openaccess/Open-APC-Sweden/).  

## Aim
**The aim of this openapc-se repository is to:**  

* Release datasets on fees paid for open access journal articles by the Swedish HEI sector under an Open Database Licence

* Demonstrate how reporting on fee-based open access publishing can be made more transparent and reproducible across institutions. This is an important aspect in the preparation for a transition from a subscription-based market to an open access publishing infrastructure 

* Establish a valid empirical foundation which can only be realised by standardised reporting on APC costs

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/Kungbib/openapc-se/wiki/Open-APC-Sweden) for more information.

## Acknowledgement  
This project follows the [Open APC Initiative](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de) to share data on paid APCs. It recognises efforts from [JISC](https://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/Jisc-Monitor/APC-data-collection/) and [FWF](https://figshare.com/articles/Austrian_Science_Fund_FWF_Publication_Cost_Data_2014/1378610) to standardise APC reporting.

## Dataset



Information on both open access journal articles and open access publication of articles in toll-access journals ("hybrid") are provided.

In total,  19434 € for  11 articles were paid by the participating unviversities. Average  fee is 1766.7 € and the median 1769 €.

## Open Access Journals



At the moment, the dataset releases information on 7 articles in open access journals which charge publication fees. Total expenditure amounts to  9311 €. Average  fee is 1330.1 € and the median 1530 €.

|    | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid| Median|
|:---|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|------:|
|mah |        3|              3539|       1179.67|   1311|
|su  |        4|              5772|       1443.00|   1608|

## Hybrid articles


In many toll-access journals some of the articles are open access after a fee has been paid. This model is often called "hybrid open access".
The dataset covers 4 hybrid open access articles. Total expenditure amounts to  10123 €. Average  fee is 2530.8 € and the median 2631 €.

The following institutions have contributed its expenditures for hybrid open access.


|    | Articles| Fees paid in EURO| Mean Fee paid| Median|
|:---|--------:|-----------------:|-------------:|------:|
|mah |        3|              7893|          2631|   2631|
|su  |        1|              2230|          2230|   2230|
