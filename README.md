# About Open APC Sweden


Open APC Sweden was initially a project by the National Library of Sweden together with Swedish higher education institutions (HEIs) in order to investigate the possibilities of establishing an transparent open access publication cost system. 

The project aimed at keeping the Swedish HEI sector informed about ways in which to monitor the total cost of publication, which includes the collection of APCs. In order to establish Open APC Sweden there is a great need for a concerted effort by stakeholders. 

As of today 25 HEI are reporting data to Open APC Sweden. 

## Aim

**The aim of this Open APC Sweden repository is to:**  

* Release datasets on fees paid for open access journal articles by the Swedish HEI sector

* Demonstrate how reporting on fee-based open access publishing can be made more transparent and reproducible across institutions. This is an important aspect in the preparation for a transition from a subscription-based market to an open access publishing infrastructure. 

* Establish a valid empirical foundation which can only be realised by standardised reporting on APC costs

## Acknowledgement  
This project follows the [Open APC Initiative](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de) to share data on paid APCs. It recognises efforts from [JISC](https://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/Jisc-Monitor/APC-data-collection/) and [FWF](https://figshare.com/articles/Austrian_Science_Fund_FWF_Publication_Cost_Data_2014/1378610) to standardise APC reporting.    

Swedish Open APC data is collected by the Open APC Initiative, and the current status in Europe is available at the [Open APC](https://treemaps.openapc.net/apcdata/openapc/). Please note that due to data cleaning differences, the results may differ between Open APC Sweden and the Open APC Initiative.
